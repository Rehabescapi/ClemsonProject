The main character is a youtuber who wants a new streaming quality for his videos. The only way he can do that is with the new GeForce RTX 3090. Unfortunately, all online ordering services are down for some reason. The only way he can get his RTX card now is by actually going into the store. The store, which is Best Buy, is currently having a black friday sale so everyone will be killing each other to buy anything they set their eyes on. The RTX cards just so happen to be in the very back of the store, where shelf stacker Andy is currently stationed.
